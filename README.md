# COVID-19 Time-Series Modelling (Coursework)

This repository contains a reproducible coursework report (HTML export) for COVID-19 case/death time-series analysis.

## Summary
- Built an end-to-end analysis pipeline: data cleaning → feature engineering → modelling → evaluation.
- Selected the optimal reporting delay (lag) using out-of-sample evaluation, comparing RMSE/MAE/R² across candidate horizons.
- Estimated linear regression parameters (β0/β1) and validated findings with plots and notebook-style reporting.
